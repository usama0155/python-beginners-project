## 📚 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning Python in a hands-on, project-based way.  
It contains exercises, mini-projects, and scripts organized by difficulty level, from **basic** concepts to **intermediate** topics.  

The goal of this repo is to:

- Track my progress over time
- Practice Python with real exercises and projects
- Build a personal code portfolio
- Serve as a reference for revisiting concepts in the future
